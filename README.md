Project Description
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project aims to build a command-line interface (CLI) tool to manage AirBnB objects. By creating this command interpreter, we are taking the first step towards developing a full web application - the AirBnB clone. This initial step is crucial as it will be utilized in all subsequent projects such as HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end integration.

Command Interpreter Description
The command interpreter is a tool that allows users to manage AirBnB objects. It enables users to perform operations such as creating new objects, retrieving objects from storage, performing operations on objects, updating object attributes, and destroying objects.

How to Start the Command Interpreter
To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the command ./console.py to start the interpreter.
How to Use the Command Interpreter
Once the command interpreter is running, you can interact with it by typing various commands to manage AirBnB objects. Some operations you can perform include creating new objects, retrieving objects, updating object attributes, and deleting objects.

Examples
Here are some examples of commands you can use in the command interpreter:

$ create User
$ show Place 1234
$ update State 5678 name "California"
